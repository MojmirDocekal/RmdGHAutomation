One, two, three.

# Introduction

This is a test document demonstrating R Markdown with extensive LaTeX package support for scientific and linguistic papers.

You can write in **Markdown** syntax for simple formatting, but you can also use LaTeX commands directly whenever needed.

# Linguistic Examples

Using the `linguex` package for numbered examples:

\ex. One brown mouse chased one white cat.

\ex. One white dog slept. 

\a. This is a sub-example. 
\b. This is another sub-example.

# Syntax Trees

Using the `qtree` package for drawing syntax trees:

\Tree [. S [.NP [.Det the ] [.N cat ] ] [.VP [.V sat ] ] ]

\bigskip

Here's a more complex tree:

\Tree [. S [.NP [.Det A ] [.N linguist ] ] [.VP [.V studies ] [.NP [.N syntax ] ] ] ]

# Mathematical Examples

This section demonstrates the use of the `amsmath` package. Here is Einstein's famous equation:

\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  Here is a more complex equation:

\begin{align}
a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{align}

# Mixed Content

You can seamlessly mix Markdown and LaTeX: 

- Markdown bullet points
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://www.latex-project.org/)

And then switch to LaTeX for specialized content:

\ex. The cat is on the mat.

\ex. \a. Who did you see? 
\b. *What did you see who? 

# Conclusion

This template demonstrates that R Markdown can handle: 

1. All standard LaTeX packages (linguex, qtree, amsmath, etc.)
2. Complex linguistic notation
3. Mathematical typesetting
4. Syntax trees
5. Regular Markdown convenience

The PDF is automatically compiled via GitHub Actions whenever you push changes to `.Rmd` files.
